            <h1>What are SMART Goals?</h1>
            <p>SMART goals are a powerful tool used in personal and professional settings to help individuals and teams define clear, achievable objectives. The term SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Setting SMART goals ensures that you can focus your efforts and track progress efficiently, which increases the likelihood of success.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Specific:</strong> Your goal must be clear and specific, answering the questions: What do I want to accomplish? Why is this goal important? Who is involved? Where is it located? Which resources or limits are involved?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Measurable:</strong> You should be able to measure your progress toward achieving the goal. Ask yourself: How much? How many? How will I know when it's accomplished?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Achievable:</strong> Your goal needs to be realistic and attainable. While it should push you out of your comfort zone, it should still be possible to achieve. Consider what it will take to accomplish the goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Relevant:</strong> The goal should matter to you and align with other objectives. It should drive you forward with purpose and be worthwhile to pursue at the moment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time-bound:</strong> Every goal needs a target deadline to ensure focus and motivation. Ask yourself: When will it be completed? What can I do today, next week, or in six months?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By following the SMART framework, you are more likely to set goals that are well-defined, realistic, and easier to track, allowing you to stay on course and achieve your objectives.</p>
